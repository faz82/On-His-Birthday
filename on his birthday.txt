Ya Allah, Ya Rabb,
Bless him through every beat of his heart,
For every breath that he takes, 
For every steps that he makes.
Ya Muhaimin,
Please keep him safe, healthy, happy;
Give him love, compassion and care.
Ya Rahman, Ya Rahim, Ya Wadud,
You planted the love, inscribed in our hearts
And the love is growing.
Take us where we want to be, Ya Rabb.
